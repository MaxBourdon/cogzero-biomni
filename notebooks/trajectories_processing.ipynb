      "\n",
      "First, I need to load the dataset. The data is in an h5ad file, so I'll use anndata to read it. Once loaded, I should check the structure of the data, especially the 'Response' column in adata.obs and the PCA components in adata.obsm['X_pca'].\n",

      "Next, I need to separate the cells into pre-treatment and post-treatment. Pre-treatment cells have NaN in the 'Response' column, while post-treatment have non-NaN. For each unique malignancy, I have to calculate the distances between all pairs of pre and post cells. Wait, but how to pair them? Since the problem says \"pre-treatment cells and post-treatment cells\", maybe it's all combinations between pre and post cells within the same malignancy group. But the user might mean that for each malignancy, compute the average distance between each pre cell and the corresponding post cells. However, since the data might not be paired (like each pre has a specific post), maybe it's just all pairwise combinations between pre and post in the same malignancy group.\n",

Then, for each malignancy, compute the Euclidean distance between each pre cell and the corresponding post cell. Wait, but how do I pair them? The problem doesn't mention a unique identifier linking pre and post cells, so maybe it's not one-to-one. Hmm, perhaps the problem is to compute the average distance between all pre and post cells within each malignancy group, not per pair. That makes more sense since there's no obvious pairing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, for each malignancy label, collect all pre-treatment cells (where 'Response' is NaN) and post-treatment cells (where 'Response' is not NaN). Then, compute the Euclidean distance between each pre cell's PCA coordinates and each post cell's PCA coordinates, sum these distances, and take the mean.

Maybe it's the average of all pairwise distances between pre and post cells within the same malignancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the average distance between the centroids of pre and post cells for each malignancy. But the problem states \"mean Euclidean distance between pre-treatment cells and post-treatment cells\", which suggests per pair. But without a pairing, maybe it's the average distance between all pre cells and all post cells within the same malignancy. So for each malignancy, compute all pairwise distances between pre and post cells, then take the mean of those distances. That would be the approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to load the dataset. The data is in an h5ad file, so I'll use anndata to read it. Once loaded, I should check the structure of the data, especially the 'Response' column in adata.obs and the PCA components in adata.obsm['X_pca'].\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I need to separate the cells into pre-treatment and post-treatment. Pre-treatment cells have NaN in the 'Response' column, while post-treatment have non-NaN. For each unique malignancy, I have to calculate the distances between all pairs of pre and post cells. Wait, but how to pair them? Since the problem says \"pre-treatment cells and post-treatment cells\", maybe it's all combinations between pre and post cells within the same malignancy group. But the user might mean that for each malignancy, compute the average distance between each pre cell and all post cells, then take the mean of those distances. \n",
      "\n",
      "So for each malignancy group, I'll split the cells into pre and post. Then, for each pre cell, calculate the Euclidean distance to each post cell in the same malignancy.

      "But how to compute the distances? Let's think. The PCA is 30 components. For each pre cell, we have a 30D vector. For each post cell, same. The Euclidean distance between a pre and a post cell is sqrt(sum((pre - post)^2)). But to compute the mean between all pre and post pairs in a malignancy group, I need to consider all possible pairs. However, if the number of pre and post cells is large, this could be computationally intensive. But given that the user is asking for the mean, maybe it's the average of all pairwise distances between pre and post cells in the same malignancy group.\n",

      "4. Find the malignancy with the highest mean distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to efficiently compute pairwise distances between two groups? Using scipy's cdist function would be efficient. For example, for a malignancy, if pre_cells is a matrix of shape (n_pre, 30) and post_cells is (n_post, 30), then cdist(pre_cells, post_cells) gives a matrix of shape (n_pre, n_post) with all pairwise distances.

      "First, I need to load the dataset. The file is in h5ad format, so I'll use anndata to read it.

However, calculating all pairwise distances might be computationally heavy, but since the dataset might not be too large, it's manageable.\n",

      "The first step is to load the data and check the columns. Then, split into pre and post based on 'Response'. Then, for each malignancy, compute the pairwise distances between pre and post cells in the first 30 PCA components (X_pca). Then take the mean for each malignancy and find the one with the highest value.\n",

      "But how to handle the PCA components? The data in adata.obsm['X_pca'] is a matrix where each row is a cell and columns are the PCs. For each pre and post cell pair, compute the Euclidean distance across the first 30 PCs.\n",

So the indices in pre_cells are 0-based for the pre-treated cells, but the original indices are different. Therefore, when I create pre_indices as np.where(malignancy_mask & pre_mask)[0], those are the original indices in adata. But to get the corresponding rows in pre_cells, I need to find the indices within the pre_cells array that correspond to those original indices.\n",

The problem says to compute the mean distance between pre and post cells for each malignancy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the average distance of each pre cell to all post cells in the same malignancy.

      "Wait, the question is to compute the mean Euclidean distance between pre and post cells.

That would give the mean pre-post distance per malignancy.\n",

      "1. Load the h5ad file.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once the data is split, for each malignancy group, extract the pre and post cells. Then, compute the pairwise distances. How to compute Euclidean distance between two sets of vectors? Using scikit-learn's pairwise_distances function, which can compute the distance matrix between two sets of samples.

    "Due to sequential `assistant` messages in a trajectory, tokenizer can act oddly (see example above).  \n",

    "  * `chat_template_kwargs` not provided → template-specific defaults. For **Qwen3**, **reasoning/thinking is enabled by default**. ([VLLM Docs][3])\n",
    "  * The server uses the model’s **HF chat template**; by default it **does not trust a client-provided template**. ([Red Hat Docs][4])\n",
    "  * If `add_generation_prompt=true` is used, the default **response role** is `\"assistant\"`. ([VLLM Docs][5])\n",
    "\n",
    "So, tokenization on vLLM is: **apply the Qwen3 chat template to the whole `messages` list with `add_generation_prompt=true`, `continue_final_message=false`, `enable_thinking=true`**, then tokenize. That means if the prompt ends with an assistant `<observation>…</observation>`, vLLM will **start a fresh assistant turn**, not continue the observation. ([VLLM Docs][1])\n",

    "1. vLLM gets `prompt` and applies `processing_class.apply_chat_template(prompt, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True)`.\n",
    "2. The model generates completion, which after decoding becomes `completion`.\n",
    "3. The correct way to mimic the inference pipeline is thus to append `completion` to the processed `prompt`.\n",
